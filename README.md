# Insights

### 🧩 Business Problem
Airlines operate across hundreds of routes and serve millions of passengers, but analyzing route efficiency,
load factor performance, and carrier preference over time can be overwhelming. 
Stakeholders often struggle to identify which routes are underperforming, 
which carriers are most preferred, and how travel patterns shift across regions and days.

---

### 🎯 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard that:
- Analyzes passenger trends across time, distance, routes, and carriers.
- Supports decisions related to route optimization, carrier benchmarking, and market segmentation.
- Uncovers patterns in load factor distribution, route popularity, and distance-based travel preferences.

### 🔍 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

- **Key KPIs**  
  Displays: Total Passengers, Average Load Factor, Total Routes, Total Carriers.  
  Provides a quick snapshot of airline operational performance.

- **Time-Based Trends (Line Charts)**  
  Monthly ,Quarterly and Yearly trend lines that help identify seasonality and long-term shifts in passenger load factor and travel volume.

- **Top Routes (Bar Chart)**  
  Shows the most traveled Origin-Destination pairs based on passenger count in country,states & city.
  Useful for identifying high-demand corridors and potential route saturation.

- **Top Carriers (Bar Chart)**  
  Compares carriers based on total passengers and load factor.  
  Helps pinpoint the most efficient or preferred airline operators.

- **Weekly Load Factor Analysis (Pie Chart)**  
  Breaks down average load factor across days of the week.  
  Reveals peak travel days and helps with schedule planning.

- **Distance Group Analysis (column Chart)**  
  Visualizes passenger preference for Short, Medium, or Long haul flights.  
  Aids in capacity planning and aircraft assignment strategies.

- **Carrier Load Comparison (Matrix/Table Visual)**  
  gives information about various term like financial month,financial Quarter based on dates.
  
- **Interactive Slicers (Year, Quarter, Carrier, Distance, Route)**  
  Allows users to filter the dashboard across various dimensions, enabling tailored insights for different business needs.
